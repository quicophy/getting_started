# Connect to the clusters, find your folder.
## Connect
To connect to the cluster enter the following command in your Linux terminal: `ssh <CC_username>@<cluster>.computecanada.ca` .

In place of `<CC_username>` enter your compute canada ID.

In place of `<cluster>` enter one of the following cluster name: 
- ``beluga``
- ``cedar``
- ``narval``
- ``graham``
- ``niagara``
If instead you wish to connect to clusters located at the University of Sherbrooke, like Mammoth, the IQ server or our own cluster Aphex, enter: `ssh <CC_username>@ip09.ccs.usherbrooke.ca`.

Press `enter`, and tape your password. You're in.

## Your working folder.
To find your folder on regular CC clusters enter the following command in your terminal: ``cd projects/def-ko1/<CC_username>`` .

For clusters at UdeS use preferably: ``cd /net/nfs-iq/data/<CC_username>/`` .

You're ready to work !

## Exit.

To exit enter ``logout`` in your terminal and press enter.
